this program can  predict if a person's liver is healthy or not when it is given a person's liver enzime data. namely 'Total_Bilirubin', 'Alkaline_Phosphotase', 'Direct_Bilirubin', 'Alamine_Aminotransferase', 'Total_Protiens'.Or you can give a csv file containing the data of multiple people and it will give various graphs based on the data given.
you have to give it the location for the training data file which is to be entered in the line no 470.
I included a sample csv file containing the details of various patients.you can either use the included file or use another file of your choice containing the same type of data
